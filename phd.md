In January 2014, I defended my Ph.D. in Computer Science: *“Properties and Impact of Vicinity in Mobile Opportunistic Networks”* in the Networks and Performance Analysis (NPA) team at the Laboratoire d’Informatique de Paris 6 (LIP6) from UPMC Sorbonne Universités in Paris. You can find the manuscript below. I worked under the supervision of [Dr Marcelo Dias de Amorim](https://www-npa.lip6.fr/~amorim/) and in collaboration with [Dr Vania Conan](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/vaniaconan) from Thales Communications & Security.

My research interests involved:

+ Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking, Intermittently Connected Mobile Networking, Opportunistic Networks
+ Intercontact Characterization in Mobile Networks
+ Wireless and Pervasive Systems

I hold a M.Sc. in Networking obtained at [UPMC Sorbonne Universités](http://www.upmc.fr/) (2010) and a [B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science from Université Paris Descartes](http://www.univ-paris5.fr/) (2008). I share my time between the [LIP6](http://www.lip6.fr)/ and the [Laboratory of Information, Network and Communication Sciences (LINCS)](http://www.lincs.fr/) which is a collaboration between [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr/), [Institut Telecom](http://www.institut-telecom.fr/), [UPMC Sorbonne Universités](http://www.upmc.fr/) and Alcatel-Lucent.

## Softwares

I have developped several softwares during my PhD thesis. They consist in contributions to open scientific libraries, tools for mobility and connectivity traces processing to original generators for opportunistic networks like Vicinity Motion, TiGeR and our Vicinity Motion-based heuristic for distance prediction. I also created personal scripts for Game Nights (Game of Thrones, Awesomenauts). I mainly work with Python (>2.7), NetworkX (>1.7) and GNU Bash (>3.2). Do not hesitate to send me an email concerning any of them.

### The Vicinity Package

The package contains:

- Vicinity Motion framework presented at the 16th ACM International Conference on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Wireless and Mobile Systems (ACM MSWiM 2013).
- TiGeR: synthetic TImeline GEneratoR.
- Vicinity-Motion based heuristic.

### TiphUtils : Trace Processing Tools

- Crawdad2One2Gexf: convert datasets from the Crawdad archive to the ONE connectivity format to instantaneous gexf graph files suitable for Gephi.

## Projects

### FP7 MOTO
- Partners: Thales, CNR, INNO, UPMC/LIP6, FON, AVEA, FIAT and INTECS.

To support the booming demand in mobile 4G data services, the MOTO project proposes to design, dimension, implement, and evaluate a new network architecture in support of dynamic traffic offloading strategies to relieve a congested 4G/LTE network. Going far beyond present infrastructure-based offloading approaches, MOTO explores an additional layer of disruptive offloading protocols that make use of direct terminal-to-terminal communications.

### ANR CROWD

- Partners: Thales, UPMC/LIP6 and 20 Minutes.

The main objective of the CROWD project is to study publish/subscribe based exchanges of user-generated multimedia information within the framework of a Web 2.0 online portal while these users are on the move and can communicate opportunistically.
